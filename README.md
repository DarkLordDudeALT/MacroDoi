# MacroDoi

I was watching an episode of the office with my mom. In the episode, Jim puts a macro on Dwight's computer. 
I thought it would be nice to have some macros on my computer, I also thought it would be kinda funny to use it against someone.

So, I made a macro program. The program loads macros in from a text file, The file has to be named macros.txt, and it must be in the same directory-level.

All macros come in this form: activatorName:parameter1;parameter2;...parameterN|executorName:parameter1;parameter2;...parameterN


At the moment, only key macros are implemented. 

Check the wiki for details.
